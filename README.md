Welcome to the GitHub repository of the final project of Ariel CHAMBAZ and Victor LEQUEUX AUDRAN made for the Framework based programming course 2024 at ITS ! This project was created to manage Books, Authors, and Categories. It features functionality to create, edit, delete, and view authors and books, with category management, and exception handling.

## Project Features

- **CRUD Operations** for Books and Authors
- **Category Management** for Books
- **View content** of a single book
- **Exception Handling** for example when trying to delete an author linked to books it notify the user that it's not possible  
- **Basic Blade Layout** with TailwindCSS for a responsive design

## Database Structure

The project uses three tables:

- **Authors**: Stores author details. We wanted to personalize the names so that they sounded french. The PHP library `Fake` allows us to do that by modifying the value of the `APP_FAKER_LOCALE`variable to `fr_FR` in the `.env` file.
- **Books**: Stores book details including title, author, category, and description.
- **Categories**: Categorizes books with predefined categories.

Here is a sample of the code written in `2024_10_06_043145_create_books_table.php` (the migration file of our `Books table`) : 
```php
public function up(): void
    {
        Schema::create('books', function (Blueprint $table) {
            $table->id();
            $table->string('title');
            $table->foreignId('author_id')->constrained('authors');
            $table->integer('published_year');
            $table->foreignId('category_id')->constrained('categories');
            $table->text('body')->nullable();
            $table->timestamps();
        });
    }
```

## Models and Relationships

- **Book** belongs to an **Author** and a **Category**.
- **Author** can have many **Books**.
- **Category** can be assigned to many **Books**.

Here is the structure of the `Books table` visualized in `TablePlus` we can see that there are 2 foreign key, one to fetch the author from the `Authors table` and one to fetch the category from the `Categories table`  : 

<p align="center">
    <img src="bookTracker/public/img/capture_book_table_structure.jpg" alt="capture_book_table_structure">
</p>

Here are the relationships defined in the models `Book.php`, `Author.php`, and `Category.php`:

```php
// In Book.php
public function author(): BelongsTo {
    return $this->belongsTo(Author::class);
}
public function category(): BelongsTo {
    return $this->belongsTo(Category::class);
}

// In Author.php
public function books(): HasMany {
    return $this->hasMany(Book::class);
}

// In Category.php
public function books(): HasMany {
    return $this->hasMany(Book::class);
}
```

## Book, Category and Authors factories and seeders

To automatically fill the tables in our database, we created new factories `BookFactory.php`, `AuthorFactory.php` and `CategoryFactory.php`. Here is a screenshot of the dummy data in the `Books table` in TablePlus:

<p align="center">
    <img src="bookTracker/public/img/capture_book_table_data.jpg" alt="capture_book_table_data">
</p>

Here is the code of `BookFactory.php`. As you can see we tried to mimic real books by generating long paragraph with spaces between them : 
```php
public function definition(): array
    {
        return [
            'title' => $this->faker->sentence(rand(2, 5)),
            'author_id' => Author::factory(),
            'category_id' => Category::inRandomOrder()->first()->id, // Assign a random category 
            'body' => implode("<br><br>", array_map(function() {
                return fake()->text(500); // Generates a longer text (300 characters).
                }, range(1, rand(5, 9))) // Generates between 3 to 5 paragraphs.
            ),
            'published_year' =>$this->faker->dateTimeBetween('-400 years', '-5 years')->format('Y'),
        ];
    }
```

To avoid having to manually activate our factories by typing commands into `Tinker` for each new fresh migration, we created seeders to automatically populate our tables with the `php artisan migrate:fresh --seed` command. Here is what we wrote in each seeder : 
```php
// In AuthorSeeder.php
public function run(): void{
    Author::factory(6)->create(); //create 6 random authors using the linked factory 
}

// In CategorySeeder.php
public function run(): void{
    Category::factory(7)->create(); //create 7 category from the list given in the linked factory
}

public function run(): void{
        $this->call([CategorySeeder::class,AuthorSeeder::class]);
        Book::factory(100)->recycle([ //create 100 books and assign to them a category and an author already created by the 2 previous seeders. 
            Category::all(),
            Author::all(),
        ])->create();
    }
```

## User Interface

The UI uses TailwindCSS for styling and includes a responsive layout for better user experience. Hereâ€™s the dashboard / homepage of our website :

<p align="center">
    <img src="bookTracker/public/img/capture_home_page_top.jpg" alt="capture_home_page_top">
</p>

Buttons for actions (add author, add book, search) change color on hover to improve usability

## Book Management

You can create, edit, and delete books. Each book belongs to an author and a category.

<p align="center">
    <img src="public/img/capture_add_book.jpg" alt="capture_add_book">
</p>

You can view the details of a single book by clicking its title. The view displays the book's title, author, category, and content.

<p align="center">
    <img src="public/img/capture_view_book.jpg" alt="capture_view_book">
</p>

Example Blade view code (file: `resources\views\books\show.blade.php`):


## Exception Management

The project includes exception handling to prevent users from deleting an author with associated books or creating a new user with an already taken email address.

<p align="center">
    <img src="public/img/capture_exception.jpg" alt="capture_exception">
</p>

Here is a sample of the code for exception handling in case of author conflict (file: `app\Http\Controllers\AuthorController.php`):

```php
public function destroy(Author $author)
    {
        try {
            // Verify if author is linked to books 
            if ($author->books()->count() > 0) {
                return redirect()->route('dashboard.index')->with('error', 'Cannot delete author with associated books.');
            }

            $author->delete();
            return redirect()->route('dashboard.index')->with('success', 'Author deleted successfully.');
        } catch (Exception $e) {
            Log::error('Error deleting author: ' . $e->getMessage());
            return redirect()->route('dashboard.index')->with('error', 'An error occurred while deleting the author.');
        }
    }
```
